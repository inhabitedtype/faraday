(** Serialization primitives built for speed an memory-efficiency.


    Faraday is a library for writing fast and memory-efficient serializers. Its
    core type and related operation gives the user fine-grained control over
    copying and allocation behavior while serializing user-defined types, and
    presents the output in a form that makes it possible to use vectorized
    write operations, such as the [writev][] system call, or any other platform
    or application-specific output APIs.

    A Faraday serializer manages an internal buffer and a queue of output
    buffers. The output bufferes may be a sub range of the serializer's
    internal buffer or one that is user-provided. Buffered writes such as
    {!write_string}, {!write_char}, {!write_bigstring}, etc., copy the source
    bytes into the serializer's internal buffer. Unbuffered writes such as
    {!schedule_string}, {!schedule_bigstring}, etc., on the other hand perform
    no copying. Instead, they enqueue the source bytes into the serializer's
    write queue directly. *)


type bigstring =
  (char, Bigarray.int8_unsigned_elt, Bigarray.c_layout) Bigarray.Array1.t

type t
(** The type of a serializer. *)


(** {2 Constructors} *)

val create : int -> t
(** [create len] creates a serializer with a fixed-length internal buffer of
    length [len]. See the Buffered writes section for details about what happens
    when [len] is not large enough to support a write. *)

val of_bigstring : bigstring -> t
(** [of_bigstring buf] creates a serializer, using [buf] as its internal
    buffer. The serializer takes ownership of [buf] until the serializer has
    been closed and flushed of all output. *)


(** {2 Buffered Writes}

    A serializer manages an internal buffer for coalescing small writes. The
    size of this buffer is determined when the serializer is created. If the
    buffer does not contain sufficient space to service a caller's buffered
    write, the serializer will allocate a new buffer of the sufficient size and
    use it for the current and subsequent writes. The old buffer will be
    garbage collected once all of its contents have been {!flush}ed. *)

val write_string : t -> ?off:int -> ?len:int -> string -> unit
(** [write_string t ?off ?len str] copies [str] into the serializer's
    internal buffer. *)

val write_bytes : t -> ?off:int -> ?len:int -> Bytes.t -> unit
(** [write_bytes t ?off ?len bytes] copies [bytes] into the serializer's
    internal buffer. It is safe to modify [bytes] after this call returns. *)

val write_bigstring : t -> ?off:int -> ?len:int -> bigstring -> unit
(** [write_bigstring t ?off ?len bigstring] copies [bigstring] into the
    serializer's internal buffer. It is safe to modify [bigstring] after this
    call returns.  *)

val write_gen
  :  t
  -> length:('a -> int)
  -> blit:('a -> src_off:int -> bigstring -> dst_off:int -> len:int -> unit)
  -> ?off:int
  -> ?len:int
  -> 'a -> unit
(** [write_gen t ~length ~blit ?off ?len x] copies [x] into the serializer's
    internal buffer using the provided [length] and [blit] operations.
    See {!Bigstring.blit} for documentation of the arguments. *)

val write_char : t -> char -> unit
(** [write_char t char] copies [char] into the serializer's internal buffer. *)

val write_uint8 : t -> int -> unit
(** [write_uint8 t n] copies the lower 8 bits of [n] into the serializer's
    internal buffer. *)


(** Big endian serializers *)
module BE : sig
  val write_uint16 : t -> int -> unit
  (** [write_uint16 t n] copies the lower 16 bits of [n] into the serializer's
      internal buffer in big-endian byte order. *)

  val write_uint32 : t -> int32 -> unit
  (** [write_uint32 t n] copies [n] into the serializer's internal buffer in
      big-endian byte order. *)

  val write_uint48 : t -> int64 -> unit
  (** [write_uint48 t n] copies the lower 48 bits of [n] into the serializer's
      internal buffer in big-endian byte order. *)

  val write_uint64 : t -> int64 -> unit
  (** [write_uint64 t n] copies [n] into the serializer's internal buffer in
      big-endian byte order. *)

  val write_float : t -> float -> unit
  (** [write_float t n] copies the lower 32 bits of [n] into the serializer's
      internal buffer in big-endian byte order. *)

  val write_double : t -> float -> unit
  (** [write_double t n] copies [n] into the serializer's internal buffer in
      big-endian byte order. *)
end


(** Little endian serializers *)
module LE : sig
  val write_uint16 : t -> int -> unit
  (** [write_uint16 t n] copies the lower 16 bits of [n] into the
      serializer's internal buffer in little-endian byte order. *)

  val write_uint32 : t -> int32 -> unit
  (** [write_uint32 t n] copies [n] into the serializer's internal buffer in
      little-endian byte order. *)

  val write_uint48 : t -> int64 -> unit
  (** [write_uint48 t n] copies the lower 48 bits of [n] into the serializer's
      internal buffer in little-endian byte order. *)

  val write_uint64 : t -> int64 -> unit
  (** [write_uint64 t n] copies [n] into the serializer's internal buffer in
      little-endian byte order. *)

  val write_float : t -> float -> unit
  (** [write_float t n] copies the lower 32 bits of [n] into the serializer's
      internal buffer in little-endian byte order. *)

  val write_double : t -> float -> unit
  (** [write_double t n] copies [n] into the serializer's internal buffer in
      little-endian byte order. *)
end


(** {2 Unbuffered Writes}

    Unbuffered writes do not involve copying bytes to the serializers internal
    buffer. *)

val schedule_bigstring : t -> ?off:int -> ?len:int -> bigstring -> unit
(** [schedule_bigstring t ?off ?len bigstring] schedules [bigstring] to
    be written the next time the serializer surfaces writes to the user.
    [bigstring] is not copied in this process, so [bigstring] should only be
    modified after [t] has been {!flush}ed. *)


(** {2 Querying A Serializer's State} *)

val free_bytes_in_buffer : t -> int
(** [free_bytes_in_buffer t] returns the free space, in bytes, of the
    serializer's write buffer. If a {write_*} call has a length that exceeds
    this value, the serializer will allocate a new buffer that will replace the
    serializer's internal buffer for that and subsequent calls. *)

val has_pending_output : t -> bool
(** [has_pending_output t] is [true] if [t]'s output queue is non-empty. It may
    be the case that [t]'s queued output is being serviced by some other thread
    of control, but has not yet completed. *)

val pending_bytes : t -> int
(** [pending_bytes t] is the size of the next write, in bytes, that [t] will
    surface to the caller as a [`Writev]. *)


(** {2 Control Operations} *)

val yield : t -> unit
(** [yield t] causes [t] to delay surfacing writes to the user, instead
    returning a [`Yield]. This gives the serializer an opportunity to collect
    additional writes before sending them to the underlying device, which will
    increase the write batch size.

    As one example, code may want to call this function if it's about to
    release the OCaml lock and perform a blocking system call, but would like
    to batch output across that system call. To hint to the thread of control
    that is performing the writes on behalf of the serializer, the code might
    call [yield t] before releasing the lock. *)

val flush : t -> (unit -> unit) -> unit
(** [flush t f] registers [f] to be called when all prior writes have been
    successfully completed. If [t] has no pending writes, then [f] will be
    called immediately. If {!yield} was recently called on [t], then the effect
    of the [yield] will be ignored so that client code has an opportunity to
    write pending output, regardless of how it handles [`Yield] operations.  *)

val close : t -> unit
(** [close t] closes [t]. All subsequent write calls will raise, and any
    pending or subsequent {!yield} calls will be ignored. If the serializer has
    any pending writes, user code will have an opportunity to service them
    before it receives the [Close] operation. Flush callbacks will continue to
    be invoked while output is {!shift}ed out of [t] as needed. *)

val is_closed : t -> bool
(** [is_closed t] is [true] if [close] has been called on [t] and [false]
    otherwise. A closed [t] may still have pending output. *)

val shift : t -> int -> unit
(** [shift t n] removes the first [n] bytes in [t]'s write queue. Any flush
    callbacks registered with [t] within this span of the write queue will be
    called. *)

val drain : t -> int
(** [drain t] removes all pending writes from [t], returning the number of
    bytes that were enqueued to be written and freeing any scheduled
    buffers in the process. *)


(** {2 Running}

    Low-level operations for runing a serializer. For production use-cases,
    consider the Async and Lwt support that this library includes before
    attempting to use this these operations directly.  *)

module IOVec : sig
(** A view into {!iovec.buffer} starting at {!iovec.off} and with length
    {!iovec.len}. *)

  type t =
    { buffer : bigstring
    ; off    : int
    ; len    : int }
end


type operation = [
  | `Writev of IOVec.t list
  | `Yield
  | `Close ]
(** The type of operations that the serialier may wish to perform.
  {ul

  {li [`Writev iovecs]: Write the bytes in {!iovecs}s reporting the actual
  number of bytes written by calling {!shift}. You must accurately report the
  number of bytes written. Failure to do so will result in the same bytes being
  surfaced in a [`Writev] operation multiple times.}

  {li [`Yield]: Yield to other threads of control, waiting for additional
  output before procedding. The method for achieving this is
  application-specific, but once complete, the caller can proceed with
  serialization by simply making another call to {!val:operation} or
  {!serialize}.}

  {li [`Close]: Serialization is complete. No further output will generated.
  The action to take as a result, if any, is application-specific.}} *)


val operation : t -> operation
(** [operation t] is the next operation that the caller must perform on behalf
    of the serializer [t]. Users should consider using {!serialize} before this
    function. See the documentation for the {!type:operation} type for details
    on how callers should handle these operations. *)

val serialize : t -> (IOVec.t list -> [`Ok of int | `Closed]) -> [`Yield | `Close]
(** [serialize t writev] sufaces the next operation of [t] to the caller,
    handling a [`Writev] operation with [writev] function and performing an
    additional bookkeeping on the caller's behalf. In the event that [writev]
    indicates a partial write, {!serialize} will call {!yield} on the
    serializer rather than attempting successive [writev] calls. *)


(** {2 Convenience Functions}

    These functions are included for testing, debugging, and general
    development. They are not the suggested way of driving a serializer in a
    production setting. *)

val serialize_to_string : t -> string
(** [serialize_to_string t] runs [t], collecting the output into a string and
    returning it. [serialzie_to_string t] immediately closes [t] and ignores
    any calls to {!yield} on [t]. *)

val serialize_to_bigstring : t -> bigstring
(** [serialize_to_string t] runs [t], collecting the output into a bigstring
    and returning it. [serialzie_to_bigstring t] immediately closes [t] and
    ignores any calls to {!yield} on [t]. *)
